# Godot Mini Projects

Four small Godot projects that showcase basic functionality and explore the different concepts that a variety of games are built upon.

## Balloon Popper

### Summary
A game in which you click on balloons until they pop, adding to the cumulative score.

### Concepts

	-Signals (mouse clicks)
	-Global Variables (score)
	-Node removal (.queue_free())
	
## Physics

### Summary
A 2D game that moves a box around using the physics engine in Godot.  The box collides with surrounding crates to create collision events to show the physics in action.

### Concepts

	-Collision Physics (weight, damping)
	-Character Movement (using the apply_impulse() function to hit the character around)
	
## Collision

### Summary
A 3D skiing game that uses the physics engine to move the character downhill as well as create collision events between the players and trees.

### Concepts

	-Character Movement (mass, friction)
	-Collision (rigid bodies)
	-Signal Detection (reload scene on collions with trees)
